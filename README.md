### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a tech entrepreneur since I was a teenager when I started a web hosting company (Gigahost) back in 2002 in JoÃ£o Pessoa, Brazil.

Gigahost survived for almost a decade before it was acquired by a bigger ISP in Brazil. In the meantime, I participated in many other ventures, including a Brazilian streaming service called Twitcast.me, a medical appointment service called Smark, a Groupon-like service called Polvo Pirata, and many other initiatives, all under a development agency umbrella called 6PS Group, based in Brazil.

In 2012, I moved to New York and eventually started another experiment called [HackHands](https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/17/though-its-network-of-mentors-hackhands-offers-live-help-for-new-programmers/), which shortly became a company and after a year it was acquired by Pluralsight. For that matter, I've moved to Utah in 2015, and kept working with Pluralsight until 2020.

Today, I'm back to my entrepreneurial journey and ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [moises.ai](https://moises.ai). I'm also partner at [Fuze](fuze.cc), a development shop based Brazil, focused on native mobile development.


I consider myself a generalist and I'm fairly proficient on these fields:
- Development (mostly Javascript/Typescript)
- Product development
- Business / Entrepreneurship
